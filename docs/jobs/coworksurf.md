# Technical Cofounder at Coworksurf

## How will people live, work and travel in 2030?

Coworksurf is a booking site & community for remote workers who love traveling and surfing, and look for a like-minded community abroad.

Since 2017, we’ve helped 3500+ nomads find and book friendly homes & communities by the surf around the world. We have recently started to capture a percentage of each booking when Wijnand joined and helped turn the site into a proper booking platform.

There's a lot of work to do, so we’re hoping to find a friendly cofounder who's a strong backend developer to join the founding team. We offer a long term focused & fair equity share of around 10% and 20%.

## Main skills we hope to find:

React, Next.js & Node.js, self-starting, entrepreneurial. We also use the framework of this website (Sensible)

### Ideal, but not necessary:

Remote work enthusiast, feeling for design, and understanding of programmable SEO.

## Mission & Vision:

A world where you can smoothly move through towns, cities and communities. Find long term, work-friendly accommodation, and instantly click into the community. We started in the surf niche, but want to expand to different niches as we go, like yoga, kitesurfing, music, snow and fitness. Either stay in a furnished private apartment, share a property with your team, or join a coliving space with other remote workers and nomads.

## Goal for next 6 months:

- Content, system & SEO site structure created to get us to 100K monthly visits by December 2022

- Reach €10K MRR

- Core booking process optimised

- Host dashboard completed

- Self-listing flow completed to add 100 new properties

We’re looking for one extra set of hands-on the backend to join our small team and get us to the next level, together.

We're trying to bootstrap this business forever, but are also open to raising angel funding in the next 6 to 12 months.

The three of us work in this in the evenings, and Thursdays, Fridays, and many Saturdays. It's not the easiest road to take in life, and you'll have to be up for it.

When you apply, we’d love to know a bit about you, why you want to join, and learn about your previous experiences.

Can’t wait to connect, and hope we’re a good fit together!

Thanks,

Pier, Jonatan and Wijnand
