# Roadmap

This is what we've done so far...

- **September 2021** Started with react-with-native: a very important pillar of Sensible
- **December 2021** Started experimenting with full-stack codebase sharing
- **January 2022** Decided to create something that became Sensible
- **February 14th** Made the codebase open source
- **May 2022** Launched v1 BETA, featuring a CLI, full-stack type-safety, doc-generation and a small VSCode plugin

This is our current long-term plan (subject to change):

- **June - October 2022** Testing with beta clients and developers, making it more stable and usable.
- **July 2022 onwards** Start promoting it for early adopters
- **August 2022** Integration and refactor to King OS architecture
- **September - December 2022** Add CMS, metascripts, sensible marketplace, endpoint docs examples
- **2023** endpoint docs: recents & errors, monetisation, and much more..!

## Ideas

In the sidebar, you can find a collection of some ideas. It is also kind of the place where we plan the implementation of the ideas, so it can be quite technical sometimes. A little insight into our company ;)

## Submit your ideas

Do you have more ideas to make Sensible even better? Feel free to discuss them in our [community](/community)!
