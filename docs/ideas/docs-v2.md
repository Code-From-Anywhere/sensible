docs v2:

- [ ] Create markdown/json CRUD API at sensible-server (in prod, must be authenticated with GitHub, on localhost, just make changes locally)
- [ ] Render CRUD of md in `docs` section
- [ ] on `docs.sensiblestack.com` without given any api, just get the sensible docs, statically generated, md obtained from `sensible.leckrapi.xyz`
- [ ] when given an api, get docs from there and generate pages at build-time.
