It would really help to make it possible to have a short description of the contents of any file or folder, available to view on the sensible-docs ui. Especially for onboarding this could save a lot of work.

- For a file, it can be done by adding a comment on in the file with `@file-description blabla` or something and reading that out.
- For a folder, it could be done with a `README.md` with a [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) description, or just a `description.md` where the text after the header is taken.
