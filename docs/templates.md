# Templates

When you are working on a template for a sensible boilerplate, some files like `package.json` and `.gitignore` need to be renamed to prevent problems with `yarn` and `npm`. Make sure you add `.template` to those files before the extension (if there is no extension, .template becomes the extension). For example, `package.json` should be named `package.template.json` and `.gitignore` should be named `.template.gitignore`.
