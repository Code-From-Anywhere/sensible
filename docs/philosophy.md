# Sensible Philosophy

* Depth first: Sensible tries to stay as flexible as possible without becoming more complex. When there are more ways to do something, we are focussing on the way we think is best, and leave the other ways for what they are. For example, we provide an integration with GitHub to automatically create a repository when you create a sensible-app. We won’t implement the same for other git storage providers, because we believe that this doesn’t provide extra value. Instead of integrating with 5 different git storage providers, we choose to put our time and energy into other cool features that would bring value. This is what we call depth first. If you want to work the sensible way, you need to use the sensible stack, and there is not always much room for flexibility.
