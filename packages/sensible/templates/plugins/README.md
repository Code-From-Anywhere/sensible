Should get this structure:

- ui: all stuff in ui/[plugin]/*
- core: all stuff in core/[plugin]/*
- server: all stuff in core/[plugin]/*
- sensible.json: configuration etc.
- README.md: instructions etc.

Once we start scaling, this should probably go to separate packages: `sensible-plugin-[plugin]`
There will probably be much more possible in this section than we are currenlty trying.
