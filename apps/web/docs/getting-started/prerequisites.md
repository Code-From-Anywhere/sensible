# Prerequisites

Although our goal is to make Sensible as easy to learn as possible, we know that we have a lot of work to do on the documentation before it will be something that even beginners can do easily.

In the first stage in which we are now, we will focus on explaining the Sensible framework itself and it is expected that you know something about react, react-native, node.js and databases.

Some useful links:

- https://reactjs.org/
- https://reactnative.dev/
- https://expo.dev - the framework we rely on for the react-native app
- https://nextjs.org - the framework we rely on for the react web-app
- https://reactwithnative.com - the framework we've built to share UI code between the above two frameworks.
- https://serverjs.io/ - the Node.js server we're using
- https://sequelize.org/ - the ORM we're using
