# Core Comparsion

- [ ] store core endpoint result in persistent store for every project added (or why not in small sqlite for sensible globally?)
- [ ] create possibility to search through multiple core's at once so they can be compared
- [ ] for every definition, add a link to github to the exact file, and a `code /relative/path` copy button so you can easily open the file
- [ ] Let people define a `sensible.json` in their root folder with contact details, their prod website domain, and a couple keys in which you can specify your openness to collaboration or code sharing. This is a nice way to easily connect people that want to build something to people that already have built something similar.
