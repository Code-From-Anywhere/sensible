# Databases

The default database for Sensible is SQLite together with the Sequelize ORM. 99% of apps don't require a more complex setup, especially if you follow Sensible's conventions. If you end up needing a more complex database set-up, you're free to install a drop-in replacement like Postgres or MySQL. It can easily be substituted, and usually there's no additional changes required besides giving the correct configuration and credentials.
