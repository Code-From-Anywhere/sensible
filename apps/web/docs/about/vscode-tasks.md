# VSCode Tasks

This project is recommended to be worked on from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and has tasks set up by default. The easiest way to start developing is to run the tasks when opening the folder. This is a setting that has to be activated only once after creating the project. If this is the first time opening this project from VSCode, run the command `Manage automatic tasks in folder` and allow it. After restarting the editor (`code -r .`) your project will be ran.
