What apps do we need for Sensible?

- **Sensible Framework (sensibleframework.co) landing page**: Just a single-page landing page that explains the concept of sensible. Later, we want to ingrate plugable docs and a plugable blog into this, but the first plan should be that it's a simple next.js project linking to a few example sensible docs.

- **Sensible Docs**: The UX for showing all sensible-generated data to the user.
