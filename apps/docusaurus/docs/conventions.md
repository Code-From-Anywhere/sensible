# Sensible Conventions

In order to keep all codebases easy for each other to understand, let's keep these conventions as much as possible.


- component/class folders and filenames should be PascalCase, all other folders kebab-case. `.md`-files should also be kebab-case.

- variables should be camelCase

- **branch names**: branch names should be composed of the project abbreviation, the issue number and a short description of the issue, e.g. K31-api-draft

- **wip prâ€™s**: always push your changes to the repo by the end of the day and make a pr for it, even if it doesn't work yet. Put the "wip" label if it's a work in progress.

- Never name a file something with `.template` unless you're actually working in a template, because this is a templating convention! See [templates](./templates)
