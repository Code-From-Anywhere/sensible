# Welcome

Sensible is a full stack typescript framework that lets you build apps super quickly and smoothly. Sensible lets you easily share your code between `React` and `React Native`, and between `front-end` and `back-end`. It has never been this easy! Sensible's mission is to boost the productivity of 100.000+ Software Developers, making it as easy as possible to build a high-quality full-stack mobile/web app.

Curious? Just run `npx sensible` and see the magic, or [check out the demo on the website](https://www.sensible.to)

Want to know more? See the [docs](https://doc.sensible.to)

## Installation instructions

1. Make sure you have `node`, `npm`, `npx`, and `brew`. If you don't, this is how to install them:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install node
```

2. call the init command of the cli.

```
npx sensible init
```

## How does it work?

Define endpoints (and other type interfaces) in a central place

![define](./assets/define-gif2.gif)

Write your endpoint with complete typesafety

![makeEndpoint](./assets/makeEndpoint-gif2.gif)

Call your endpoint with complete type-safety and autocompletion (no boilerplate needed!)

![api](./assets/api-gif2.gif)

If you need more help, just look in the auto-generated docs!

# The Core Sensible Philosophy

- Codebase introspection (Documentation generation)
- Full-stack code-sharing (full-stack auto-completion using Typescript)
- Maximise learnability, minimise tech debt, simplify onboarding
- Decentralised, Open Source, Automatic
