# Welcome

Sensible is a full stack typescript framework that lets you build apps super quickly and smoothly. Sensible lets you easily share your code between `React` and `React Native`, and between `front-end` and `back-end`. It has never been this easy! Sensible's mission is to boost the productivity of 100.000+ Software Developers, making it as easy as possible to build high-quality full-stack mobile- and web-apps.

Curious? Just run `npx sensible` and see the magic, or [check out the demo](https://demo.sensiblestack.com)

Want to know more? See the [docs](https://sensiblestack.com)

## Installation instructions

1. Make sure you have `brew`, `node`, `npm` and `npx`. If you don't, this is how to install them:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install node
```

2. call the init command of the cli.

```
npx sensible init
```

NB, if you are on an aold version, run `npx sensible@latest init` to update it first.

## How does it work?

Define endpoints (and other type interfaces) in a central place

![define](./assets/define-gif2.gif)

Write your endpoint with complete typesafety

![makeEndpoint](./assets/makeEndpoint-gif2.gif)

Call your endpoint with complete type-safety and autocompletion (no boilerplate needed!)

![api](./assets/api-gif2.gif)

If you need more help, just look in the auto-generated docs!

## The Core Sensible Philosophy

- Codebase introspection (Documentation generation)
- Full-stack code-sharing (full-stack auto-completion using Typescript)
- Maximise learnability, minimise tech debt, simplify onboarding
- Decentralised, Open Source, Automatic

## Demo

Check [our demo](https://demo.sensiblestack.com) here.

To run the app locally, do the following

- clone this repo
- follow the [expo installation instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) of expo (react-native)
- `yarn` in root folder
- `yarn dev` in root folder
- new terminal tab: `yarn start:server` in root folder
- new terminal tab: `yarn start:app` in root folder. Open your camera and **scan the QR code** or run the app using the simulator ([XCode required](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/))
- new terminal tab: `yarn start:web` in root folder (show it at http://localhost:3000)
