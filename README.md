# The Shared Full Stack Typescript Framework

With strict conventions and the newest typescript and code sharing possibilities, we were able to create the most advanced typescript framework ever and boost the productivity of hundreds of development teams, maybe even by a factor of 10 or more if you compare it to the industry standard.

Sensible's mission is to boost the productivity of 100.000+ Software Developers, making it as easy as possible to build a high-quality full-stack mobile/desktop app/website.

Curious? Just run `npx sensible` and see the magic, or [check out the demo on the website](https://www.sensible.to)

This will setup the sensible framework with all node modules installed, a small example, and it will also open up VSCode in the correct folder.

## Installation instructions

1. Make sure you have `node`, `npm` and `npx`. If you don't, this is how to install it with brew:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install node
```

2. call the init command of the cli.
   `npx sensible init`

## How does it work?

Define endpoints (and other type interfaces) in a central place

![define](./assets/define-gif2.gif)

Write your endpoint with complete typesafety

![makeEndpoint](./assets/makeEndpoint-gif2.gif)

Call your endpoint with complete type-safety and autocompletion (no boilerplate needed!)

If you need more help, just look in the auto-generated docs!

# The Core Sensible Philosophy

- Codebase introspection (Documentation generation)
- Full-stack code-sharing (full-stack auto-completion using Typescript)
- Maximise learnability, minimise tech debt, simplify onboarding
- Decentralised, Open Source, Automatic
